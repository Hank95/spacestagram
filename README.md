##Check out [Spacestagram](https://spacestagram-hank95.vercel.app)

Built with Next.js, Tailwind CSS, NASA Picture of the Day API, and utilizing Reacts Context API for Data management.


You can like photos and then see your like photos all in one place.  You can search photos by the month.  With some more time I would like to have added a dark mode, imporve the search and sort, further the UX/UI, and then maybe add a backend to add users and authenticat them so there liked data would persist.  

This was built for the Front End Developer Intern Challenge - Summer 2022!

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
